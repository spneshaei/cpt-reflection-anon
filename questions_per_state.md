# Questions Per State

## Metacognition

- 'What have you done well, and what was easy? Why? Describe elaborately!'
- 'What kind of mistakes have you made, and what was difficult? Why? Describe elaborately!'
- 'What kinds of competencies did you practice and what kind of knowledge did you need to use in the situation?'

## Connection

- 'How could you apply the competencies that you have learned, outside of your professional life?'
- 'Can you think of another situation where you experienced similar competencies or mistakes?'

## Organization

- 'If you wanted to communicate your experience to others, how would you have started?'
- 'What is your central theme, and how do you continue your writing based on that?'
- 'How would you ensure that you highlight in your writing what is important, and show connections to what you knew or didn't know from before?'

## Metacognition Again

- 'Do you think there is anything you missed when iterating over what you did and did not do well or understand, in the beginning of our conversation? If yes, say it'
- 'Based on what you learned, how would you act the next time a similar situation happens?'
- 'Do you have any final questions? If yes, ask it'
